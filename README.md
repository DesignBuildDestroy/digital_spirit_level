# Design Build Destroy - Digital Level

[![Design Build Destroy Arduino Digital Level](http://img.youtube.com/vi/232jer4HIZc/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=232jer4HIZc)

A Digital Spirit Level using Arduino Nano and MPU6050 that can show precise angles up to a little more than 45 degrees. Mimics the 3 measurements of any decent standard bubbel level, Horizontal LEVEL, Vertical PLUMB and 45 Degree. Designed with a 3d printed enclosure that is sturdy and looks like any standard level.

## Features
- OLED Display to display current angle and LEVEL/PLUMB indicator, menu options
- Auto screen rotation so the text is always readable no matter what angle the device is held at including upside down.
- Auto Calibration for first time setup
- Menu options for Normal display (angle rounded to nearest whole number) or Precision mode (angle will include 1 decimal point value) & Auto Calibration
- Calibration values saved to internal EEProm so it only needs to be performed once
